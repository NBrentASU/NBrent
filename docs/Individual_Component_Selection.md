#### Selection

The LM2594M is the best option for my electromagnetâ€™s power needs. The wide range of voltage adjustability on the inputs and outputs allows for it to be tweaked as needed to use the full power of the designed magnet. The extra room for experimentation will allow for the best outcome possible.
