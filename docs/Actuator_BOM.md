Above is the complete list of components required to build the Actuator system. The unit cost of each item is the price per 1 of that component whereas the production cost is based on the 100 unit pricing. The reason for this is that this is a science museum exhibit rather than a mass produced item needing thousands of each component. The only items unaccounted for price-wise are those given by the Peralta Lab at ASU according to instructor directions. Overall, this actuation system costs $### per unit coming in under the 60 dollar maximum per individual.
