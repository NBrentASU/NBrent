## Project Definition

The project for Team 310 in EGR 314 is to design a STEM museum exhibit to teach any aspect or principle of STEM to K-12th grade students. Our team decided to demonstrate electromagnetism by accelerating a steel marble along a circular track either forwards or backwards. This will be accompanied by an HMI system to display data and control speeds/timings of the actuator. A sensor system will use a shift register to detect where the ball is and control electromagnetic switchings. A live print out of this data will be tracked and stored on an MQTT internet server and conveyed to the HMI server for display.

## Team Contribution

For Team 310, my contribution is the actuator subsystem.

Some Requirements for this system include:

- SPI communication with drivers and microchip
- Bidirectional control of marble
- Recieving and sending messages to other systems through UART
- Attempt to make marble accelerated as fast as possible
  
Pages will be updated throughout the semester to demonstrate project progress
